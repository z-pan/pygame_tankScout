My project is "World of Tanks", a game based on Pygame.
Open the python file Zeny_Pan_15-112_term_project_WOT.py to run the game.
Make sure you have Pygame module installed on your computer.
If you do not have Pygame installed on your computer, you can go to http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml to download one and install it.
